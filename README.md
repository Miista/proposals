# Proton programming language proposals 

Here we'll propose and discuss about what should be and what not in the Proton programming language.

These are the steps to follow in order to make a proposal:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a folder with your proposal (**it must be in markdown**)
3. Make a pull request

Discussion will be held in the comment section of every pull request. Every proposal's pull request will be kept open until discussion is done or we vote upon it.
